<b>Falcon Programming Language Development Environment in Qt</b>

This Development Environment is brought to you by SpinalSoft (AU) and is (C) SpinalSoft (AU) 2018.

It is built using the community version of QtCreator (https://www.qt.io/) using Qt 5.12.0 and is released under the same licence (MIT) as QCodeEditor.

QCodeEditor is by <b>Megaxela</b> https://github.com/Megaxela/QCodeEditor

The various themes used are :

<ol><b>Crystal Hammer</b> https://cryham.tuxfamily.org/themes#Qt_Creator</ol>
<ol><b>Dark Code</b> http://gitlab.unique-conception.org/qt-tools/qtcreator-dark-code-style/blob/master/dark_code.xml</ol>
<ol><b>Dracula</b> https://draculatheme.com</ol>
<ol><b>Eclipse</b> http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=3741</ol>
<ol><b>Monokai</b> https://github.com/bfrg/qtcreator-monokai</ol>
<ol><b>Sublime Material</b> https://www.buymeacoffee.com/foxoman</ol>
<ol><b>Tomorrow Theme</b> https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme</ol>
<ol><b>VS2012</b> https://blog.benjaminhuang.me/2013/02/14/qt-creator-color-scheme-msvs2012-style/</ol>

Hopefully this software is straightforward to use, but there are a couple of things I would like to point out:

1) The <b>Debug</b> and <b>Step</b> options in the <b>Run</b> menu do not work as there is currently no debugger for Falcon.

2) There are several settings that can be changed by clicking on the <b>Settings</b> menu:

<ol><b>Word Wrap</b> - Text is wrapped at end of line, or not at all.</ol>
<ol><b>Read Only</b> - The entire document becomes Read Only. Though can still be saved.</ol>
<ol><b>Auto Indentation</b> - Apply indentation on new line.</ol>
<ol><b>Tab Replace</b> - Replace an input "Tab" with spaces. </ol>
<ol><b>NB:</b> The number of spaces for Tab Replace is denoted by the value in the spin box below this option.</ol>
<ol><b>Auto Parentheses</b> - Automatically apply closing parentheses.</ol>
