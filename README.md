Falcon Programming Language Development Environment in Qt

This Development Environment is brought to you by SpinalSoft (AU) and is (C) SpinalSoft (AU) 2018.

It is built using the community version of Qt (https://www.qt.io/) and is released under the same licence (MIT) as QCodeEditor (see README.md file).

QCodeEditor is by Megaxela (https://github.com/Megaxela/QCodeEditor)

The various themes are :
Crystal Hammer (https://cryham.tuxfamily.org/themes#Qt_Creator)
Dark Code (http://gitlab.unique-conception.org/qt-tools/qtcreator-dark-code-style/blob/master/dark_code.xml)
Dracula (https://draculatheme.com)
Eclipse (http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=3741)
Monokai (https://github.com/bfrg/qtcreator-monokai)
Sublime Material (https://www.buymeacoffee.com/foxoman)
Tomorrow Theme (https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme)
VS2012 (https://blog.benjaminhuang.me/2013/02/14/qt-creator-color-scheme-msvs2012-style/)

Hopefully this Development Environment is straightforward to use!

There are only a couple of things I would like to point out:

1) The "Debug" and "Step" options in the "Run" Menu do not work as there is currently no debugger for Falcon.

2) There are several settings that can be changed by clicking on the "Settings" Menu:

    Word Wrap - Text is wrapped at end of line, or not at all.
    Read Only - The entire document becomes "Read Only".
    Auto Indentation - Apply indentation on new line.
    Tab Replace - Replace "Tab" with spaces. 
	                The number of spaces is denoted by the value in the spin box below this option.
    Auto Parentheses - Automatically apply closing parentheses.
